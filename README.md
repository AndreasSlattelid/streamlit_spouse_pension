# Overview 

The goal of this project was to learn Streamlit, and show how it can be used in life-insurance. The goal was also learn how to deploy apps to Azure, this is still the goal, and hopefully soon I'll be there! 

For the time being the app is hosted [here](https://andreasslattelid-streamlit-spouse-pension-spouse-app-4ptl96.streamlit.app/) using Streamlit cloud. There still is a lot of learning required: 

* Managing reactivity properly in Streamlit. 
* App design in general
* Docker
